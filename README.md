Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to store, process and move data fast. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware.

The Arrow Python bindings (also named PyArrow) have first-class integration with NumPy, pandas, and built-in Python objects. They are based on the C++ implementation of Arrow.
